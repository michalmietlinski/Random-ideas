# Random-ideas
Collection of ideas and thought for use and fun!


## It's all about getting other people ideas, improving them and implementing
* some of those ideas are completely taken from other sources - i'll try to share sources
* some of those ideas are remixes of already created solutions
* some are brand new, make them real!

## It's not about perfection 
* Quality is gain by repetition - in order to get there you first have to actually make something.
