# Goal funds

Goal funds should be government run, legislated and independantly controlled projects.

They should be partially self funded, and partially founded through revenue / savings generated;

## Steps:
1. Define goals for fund;
2. Analyze source of initial funding;
3. Prepare specs for availlable actions performed by fund;
4. Create additional revenue stream from sale / savings generated by funds actions;
5. Create measurement tools and points of interest;
6. Provide priotities of actions with budget percentage assigned to them;
7. Legistlate fund, appoint people responsible for management as well as audit;
8. Publish report about funds actions quarterly;

The best fund would have small initial capital provided from taxes and year by year it's budget would grow through actions performed.

## Example:
### Fund - Electricity saving;
### Initial source of capital 
small tax on carbon production / petrol;

### Performed actions:
* Funding of improvements to light / utilities using electric power, with set up fee equal to part of savings achieved by for example city building;
* Creating small and medium solar energy plants especially for institutions working during daytime - with similar fee as a percentage of savings;
* Applying improved city light systems with cooperation with local authorities;
* Creating grants and prizes for energy saving solutions;
* Upgrading infrastructure for both quality of life, and electric usage awerness;

### Possible goals:
* Save up to 1 TWh a year in country;
* Achieve additional revenue through energy savings equal to initial capital - after which this source of capital would be free for new Fund;
* Provide 10 grants a yeay;
