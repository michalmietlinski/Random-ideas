## Some ideas:

### City availlability

Special licence plates to make it recognizable for Police force
All Park and Ride parkings with added option of charging and Solar Power
Free in city parking
Use of bus passes
No additional cost of entering the city
Lower fee on highway for EV and hybrid cars/buses/trucks
Special Ev zones - parking with charger for EVs + Solar roof

### More charging station
Paid by some kind of Goal set tax on petrol
1st - all highway parkings and petrol stations
2nd - all shopping malls
3rd - all park and ride parkings
4th - all administrative buildings
5th - stations in larger urban areas

### Taxes
No sale tax on EV cars;
Lower Duty tax on EV technologies;

### Public transportation
Focus on developing technology with local industries participating
Force step by step change in fleet of buses in larger cities - providing cheap used fleet(still relatively new) to smaller cities, changing bus fleet year by year.
All costs of running buses should be counted, and saving put in Goal based funds with goals such as: modernizing fleet, creating additional charging stations, charging wirelessly buses during stops;

Provide incentives for City to City electric bus transport companies.
