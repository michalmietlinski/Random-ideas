# Schools - buildings

## Electricity

* Schools have large roofs, and operate mostly during day, with relatively small power pack all of them could be easily self sufficient using solar panels; 
* Additional heating could be provided via heat exchangers;
* Additional power generator with backup light system could easily transform schools into emergancy gathering points;

## Lights

* All lights should be replaced - step by step with warm LED improving quality of time for students, as well as concentration. Reducing power consumption and maintanance cost;

## Air quality

* During technical classes some bio detergents could be easily created, providing school with cleaning materials with less health impact on students;
* All classes could be run by responsible teams with role of keeping plants alive and well(NASA made list of air cleaning plants);
* All schools could be provided with mobile ozone generators, clearing periodically all classes;
